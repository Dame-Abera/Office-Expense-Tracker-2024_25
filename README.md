## Database Technology Justification

For our **office expense tracker web application**, we chose **PostgreSQL** as the database technology, paired with **Prisma ORM**. The decision is based on the following reasons:

- **Relational Data Structure**: The application involves structured data with clear relationships, such as **users, roles, and expenses**. PostgreSQL efficiently handles relational data with support for **complex queries and constraints**.

- **ACID Compliance**: PostgreSQL ensures **data integrity and reliability**, which is critical for tracking expenses accurately.

- **Scalability**: As the application grows, PostgreSQL can scale **vertically and horizontally**, providing **long-term flexibility**.

- **Integration with Prisma**: **Prisma ORM** simplifies database management with **type-safe queries, schema migrations,** and **developer-friendly tools**, enhancing productivity.

This combination ensures **efficient** and **maintainable backend** for our application.
